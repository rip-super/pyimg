PYIMG is a standalone image file format with a size typically within 10% of a .png file. While it cannot match the compression ratios of lossy formats like JPEG, it is a strong competitor among lossless formats. You can use either the pyimg.py script or the .exe CLI application to encode, view, or convert images to the PYIMG formats. The program leverages advanced compression libraries to offer performance comparable to PNG and other popular formats. Download today and experience the difference for yourself!

Usage for the scripts is as follows:
pyimg.<py/exe> <encode/fwrite/view> <path_to_file>
